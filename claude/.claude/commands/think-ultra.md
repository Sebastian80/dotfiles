description: Maximum depth analysis (ultrathink) - exhaustive reasoning with expert debate for complex problems
---

Ultrathink about this problem. You are now in ULTRA ANALYSIS MODE with EXPERT PANEL DEBATE.

## Phase 1: Problem Decomposition
- Break down the problem into atomic sub-problems
- Identify dependencies between sub-problems
- Map the solution space
- **State explicit hypotheses** about what might work

## Phase 2: Expert Panel Debate (Tree of Thoughts)
Simulate three expert perspectives debating this problem:

**Expert A (Pragmatist):** Focus on simplest working solution
**Expert B (Architect):** Focus on long-term maintainability and patterns
**Expert C (Devil's Advocate):** Challenge every assumption, find flaws

Each expert:
1. States their initial position
2. Critiques the others' positions
3. Revises based on valid criticisms
4. **If an expert realizes they're wrong, they concede**

## Phase 3: Multi-Perspective Analysis
- Consider from user's perspective
- Consider from system's perspective
- Consider from maintainer's perspective
- Consider from security perspective
- Consider from performance perspective

## Phase 4: Solution Generation
- Generate at least 3 distinct approaches from surviving expert positions
- For each approach:
  - Pros and cons
  - Implementation complexity (1-5 scale)
  - Risk assessment (what could go wrong)
  - Long-term implications
  - **Conditions under which this approach fails**

## Phase 5: Adversarial Self-Critique
- Attack your preferred solution ruthlessly
- What would a senior engineer criticize?
- What edge cases break it?
- What assumptions are you making that might be wrong?
- **If critique reveals fatal flaw, backtrack to Phase 4**

## Phase 6: Synthesis
- Select and justify the optimal approach
- Acknowledge trade-offs explicitly
- Define clear implementation steps
- Identify verification criteria
- **State confidence level (low/medium/high) with reasoning**
