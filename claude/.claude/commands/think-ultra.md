description: Maximum depth analysis (ultrathink) - exhaustive reasoning for complex problems
---

Ultrathink about this problem. You are now in ULTRA ANALYSIS MODE. This is for the most complex problems requiring exhaustive reasoning.

## Phase 1: Problem Decomposition
- Break down the problem into atomic sub-problems
- Identify dependencies between sub-problems
- Map the solution space

## Phase 2: Multi-Perspective Analysis
- Consider from user's perspective
- Consider from system's perspective
- Consider from maintainer's perspective
- Consider from security perspective
- Consider from performance perspective

## Phase 3: Solution Generation
- Generate at least 5 distinct approaches
- For each approach:
  - Pros and cons
  - Implementation complexity
  - Risk assessment
  - Long-term implications

## Phase 4: Critical Evaluation
- Challenge your own assumptions
- Identify potential blind spots
- Stress-test the preferred solution
- Consider what experts would critique

## Phase 5: Synthesis
- Select and justify the optimal approach
- Define clear implementation steps
- Identify verification criteria

Now apply this framework to: $ARGUMENTS
