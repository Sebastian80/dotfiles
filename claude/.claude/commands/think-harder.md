description: Deep analysis mode (megathink) - think step-by-step with extended reasoning
---

Think hard about this problem. You are now in DEEP ANALYSIS MODE. Before responding:

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - What exactly is being asked?
   - What are the constraints and requirements?
   - What information do I have vs need?

2. **Explore Alternatives**
   - What are at least 3 different approaches?
   - What are the trade-offs of each?
   - Which best fits the constraints?

3. **Consider Edge Cases**
   - What could go wrong?
   - What assumptions am I making?
   - How might this fail in production?

4. **Validate Before Responding**
   - Does my solution actually solve the problem?
   - Is it the simplest solution that works?
   - Have I missed anything obvious?

Now analyze: $ARGUMENTS
